TestCase 1
All 4 choose 3 combinations:
We compute the constant term c (i.e. f(0)) using Lagrange Interpolation on each of these:

Points: (1,4), (2,7), (3,12) → c = 1

Points: (1,4), (2,7), (6,39) → c = 1

Points: (1,4), (3,12), (6,39) → c = 1

Points: (2,7), (3,12), (6,39) → c = 1

All combinations give the same constant c = 1.

Output:
Secret from input1.json: 1

------------------------------------------------------------

TestCase 2
Try combinations:
(1,4), (2,7), (3,12) → c = 1

(1,4), (2,7), (6,43) → c = 5

(1,4), (3,12), (6,43) → c = 9

(2,7), (3,12), (6,43) → c = 17

Different values of c from each combination.

Output:
Inconsistent secrets in input2.json: [1, 5, 9, 17]
